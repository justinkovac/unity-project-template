# Unity Project Template (empty)

This is a wicked basic project folder setup for any of your new projects.  Sorry for the REMOVE-ME.txt files, GitHub won't let you commit empty folders!

Additionally, you will find 4 Manager scripts within the Scripts/Managers/ directory.  These are set up as singletons for you to add to your own Manager GO(s).  This allows you to easily reference logic within these scripts without needing to call GetComponent in any of your additional components.

### Current Scripts

  - Scripts\Managers\GameManager.cs
  - Scripts\Managers\EnemyManager.cs
  - Scripts\Managers\MusicManager.cs
  - Scripts\Managers\ScoreManager.cs
